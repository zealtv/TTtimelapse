IP camera capture and timelapse playback application written in openFrameworks

Written in openFrameworks 0.8.4, xCode 6, for mac minis running two monitors @ 720p

This was built for an art installation by Tintin Wulia for the Global Imaginations exhibition, June 27 to October 4, 2015 in Leiden.  (http://lakenhal.nl/en/story/meelfabriek-2015)

The installation runs on 4 mac minis connected to 4 IP cameras and 8 displays.  The application periodically captures images from the IP cameras whilst simultaneously displaying a timelapse sequence of previously captured and sorted frames as well as a live feed from the cameras.
The captured frames were sorted into those which contained people and those which contained no people by way of a mechanical turk system, creating contrasting timelapse sequences.
